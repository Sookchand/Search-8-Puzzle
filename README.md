# Search 8 Puzzle Problem
This is a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles to form a particular configuration.

The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution to the 8-puzzle problem. The algorithm works by exploring the search tree and expanding the most promising nodes. The algorithm uses a heuristic to determine which nodes are the most promising. In this case, the heuristic used is the number of misplaced tiles.
