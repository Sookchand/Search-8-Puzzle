## Lessons Learned

- Instance segmentation is the process of segmenting out individual objects in an image.
- PixelLib is a library that makes it easy to use Mask R-CNN to perform instance segmentation.
- The Mask R-CNN architecture is composed of a feature extractor, region proposal network and a classification layer.
- When training a model, it is important to consider the data quality, the hyperparameters and the model architecture.
